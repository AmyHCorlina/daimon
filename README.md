# sensor-daemons
We at Corlina are creating this project to share the applications we have written to capture IoT sensor data. Our use cases are specifically targeted at Industrial IoT including manufacturing floors, warehouses, and even retail spaces.
# Motivation
We are hoping to create a community that will improve on what we have and also contribute new applications to this repository.
# Contributing
Here are some basic principles for contributing:
1. Include a short description for the application
1. Installation instructions for the application itself
1. Hardware setup instructions - pictures are wonderful! You could link to a website but this will require that you keep that link current.
1. Test your application throughly and include the steps and results to help others
1. Include any caveats where the application may not work as expected
1. Any other notes that may be beneficial to the end user
